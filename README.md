## 24-well-plate-confluency-holes

3D printer instructions for a piece of plastic that sticks underneath a 24-well tissue culture plate. Each well on the plate has 4 holes through which the cell confluency can be measured. Each hole is exactly the size of the field of view under the 5x objective lens of the Zeiss Axiovert 25 phase-contrast microscope (may also be suitable for other microscopes).

Instructions for use of the 3D printed plastic:
1. Centre the hole in the field of view under the 5x objective lens. If desired, you can then switch to a higher magnification, but without moving the hole.

2. Take a photo of the cells in each of the 4 holes of one well on the plate. (Can do this at any of the magnifications).

3. Calculate the confluency for each of the 4 holes (e.g., using a software such as ImageJ).

4. Take the average of the 4 confluencies as the confluency in that well.
